    "1) Did a worse economy (such as around 2008) affect the used car sales? \n",
    "2) Have car prices increased over time globally, or does it rise and fall?\n",
    "\n",
    "My data showed: \n",
    "1) It seems that right before the 2008 recession there was a surge in car sales, then it dropped steeply and has mostly been rising ever since, until 2018 or 2019 when it started dropping, but this could be due to a lack of sales being made on Craiglist.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The average price has definetly gone up and down a lot, mostly rising right at the beginnning of Craigslist which might be due to novelty of the selling method, before settling into a lower mostly stable average price, before shooting back up in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very worth noting that this data is skewed in many ways. It only considers used car sales made on Craigslist, and it only includes listing price since the site does not track the final prices.  "
